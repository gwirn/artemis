This Plugin helps you to navigate the buffer list and see the context of the
jumps.

Example:

                                                            *artemis.visjump()*
artemis.visjump()
    Shows two floating windows.
    Artemis: here you can navigate with vim motions like any other file. It
    shows the content of the line of each entry in the jumplist.
    Preview: shows the surrounding content (lines in the file) of the current
    line in Artemis.
    >
    artemis.visjump()
<
    To select a jump and go to it:
        Navigate to the line in the floating window Artemis and press <CR>
    To close the floating windows without any action:
        Press <ESC>

    This keymappings get assigned when |artemis.visjump()| is used and reset
    afterwards to the keymappings that where there before. So it will change
    these mappings only for the time when the floating window is open.
